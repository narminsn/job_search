Developing great products is about being equally concerned with building the right thing as building it well.</p>\n<p>As a senior full stack developer at Table XI, we'd want you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lead projects, provide technical guidance, identify risks, proactively learn and share, and mentor more junior team members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expertly develop both back-end and front-end code</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Understand client's business, build relationships with clients, and guide strategic decisions to make client successful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicate professionally and empathetically, solicit and provide feedback, actively offer help, and make sure everyone is aligned</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Guide architecture and implementation discussions, help unblock other developers, establish best practices for maintainability, and strategically balance test coverage, risk and budget</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take responsibility (even when no one asks)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work collaboratively on a cross-functional team of developers, designers, and business analysts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn from everyone, no matter what their title is.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious, talented and hungry, we want to hear from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Back-end: we primarily create applications in Ruby on Rails, though we have a small number of applications with other setups: Elixir and Phoenix, Node and Sails or Express, and even some old Perl apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Front-end: we either use Bulma or craft CSS from scratch following the ideas of ITCSS. For Javascript, we generally use React, though we have some apps that use Stimulus for when React is too big of a hammer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mobile: we support native iOS development in both Objective-C and Swift. These days, though, almost all of our apps are being built in React Native.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Infrastructure: nearly all of our infrastructure is on AWS and managed by Terraform and chef.

To deliver the best solutions, we need as many bright and diverse minds in the room as possible, and we need to be able to learn from them once they\u2019re there. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working to create an environment that\u2019s comfortable and inclusive for everyone. We know the tech industry isn't always as welcoming as it should be. But we're happy to do the work of making it better, both at our company and in our community.</p>\n<p>Our team is important to us and we're excited to have been recognized as both one of Built in Chicago's 50 Best Small Companies to Work For in Chicago 2019 and Inc. Magazine's America's Best Workplaces of 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>\n<p>For 16 years, we've built our software development consultancy around three small words and one big idea: tech done right. To us, it means more than clean code and sound design. It means doing right by our partners, by our peers and by our community.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re a curious and humble group of people who love to build things. Learning is the key to our culture, and we\u2019re always looking for new skills to pick up and ways to hone our craft. We bring that same curiosity to our clients, digging into their needs so we can make sure our design and development projects look great, work great and push client businesses forward. Our clients look to us as a strategic partner, and we make decisions that affect their long-term success.</p>\n<p><strong>We've Helped</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Northwestern University research facilities perform and advance clinical research</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AccuWeather prototype and design new features for their weather applications</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tyson Foods deploy Design Thinking methods to create one of Time magazine's top 10 smartest, most sustainable products of 2018</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More than 25,000 people participate in Chicago Ideas Week each year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies ensure that medicines and vaccines are manufactured and stored properly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PechaKucha build a global community of storytellers, in over 1100 cities around the world</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Roger Ebert solidify his legacy as a film critic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But the work is just part of what makes Table XI a fun place to be. We make time for people to follow their interests, whether that's volunteering at Code Platoon, speaking at RailsConf, learning a new framework or writing books. If there's something you're passionate about, we want to help you pursue it so you can teach it to the rest of us. Our weekly Lunch and Learns have covered everything from an X-Files approach to design, React/Redux basics, culinary skills for home cooks, to website performance testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyone on Our Team Enjoys</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Daily gourmet meals cooked in-house with vegetarian, gluten-free, and other options available</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The promise of minimal travel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A casual loft office that pairs an open floor plan with quiet rooms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive salary</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aetna health insurance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>401k plan, including employer matching</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We Take Equality Seriously</strong></p>\n<p>Table XI is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is committed to equal opportunity employment without regard to race, religion, color, gender (including gender identity, change of sex and transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry, national origin, military or veteran status, marital status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.</p>\n<p>All offers of employment are conditioned upon the candidate\u2019s completion of a Form I-9 and delivery of appropriate documentation to establish the candidate\u2019s identity and legal authorization to work in the United States.</p>\n",

Naast samen met collega\u2019s interessante opdrachten uitvoeren leer je ook samen. Elke cursus of interessante ervaring wordt in een pizza avond met iedereen behandelt. Zo leer je ook van die gave cursus van een collega.

We zetten ons in om onze klanten inzicht te geven en samen veilige en werkbare systemen te cre\u00ebren en onderhouden. Als hacker draag je hier direct aan bij door onze klanten inzicht te geven in het beveiligingsniveau van hun systemen, het aantonen van de eventuele impact van kwetsbaarheden en adviseren over eventuele verbeteringen daarbinnen.</p>\n<p>Een greep uit de werkzaamheden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uitvoeren van interne en externe pentests;</li>\n<li>Uitvoeren van diepgaande webapplicatie pentests;</li>\n<li>Uitvoeren van social engineering aanvallen;</li>\n<li>Uitvoeren van source code reviews;</li>\n<li>Rapporteren, presenteren en adviseren van de resultaten aan de klant;</li>\n<li>Delen van je kennis en ervaring ter lering ende vermaak met collega\u2019s van het security research, threat intelligence &amp; blue team om hen te helpen betere preventieve en detectieve maatregelen te treffen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hierbij maak je gebruik van de volgende methoden/tools/programma\u2019s:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruime ervaring met Windows &amp; Linux;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met tools als:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Metasploit</li>\n<li>Frida</li>\n<li>BurpSuite</li>\n<li>Kali</li>\n<li>Jad</li>\n<li>Ntlmrelayx</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ervaring op het gebied van scripting/programmeren, bijvoorbeeld:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bash;</li>\n<li>Python;</li>\n<li>Ruby;</li>\n<li>PHP;</li>\n<li>.NET.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wat breng jij ons?</h2>\n<p>Als ethical hacker ben je voortdurend bezig met de nieuwste trends in het security vakgebied. Je bent creatief en hebt het doorzettingsvermogen om kwetsbaarheden uit te buiten. Je bent in staat om zelf (web)applicaties te schrijven, zodat je weet waar kwetsbaarheden zich kunnen bevindingen. Je vertrouwt niet zonder meer op de output van een tool, je verifieert altijd de resultaten om te controleren of de bevindingen juist zijn. Kortom, je hebt de juiste \u201chackers mindset\u201d.</p>\n<h2>Daarnaast hebben we de volgende verwachtingen:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MBO/HBO/WO ICT afgerond;</li>\n<li>Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) afgerond, of bereid deze te behalen;</li>\n<li>Bovengemiddelde interesse in security;</li>\n<li>Goede beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal in woord en geschrift;</li>\n<li>Klantgericht, probleemoplossend, creatief, leergierig, verantwoordelijk en discreet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Om in te stromen als medior/senior verwachten we aanvullend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2-3 relevante werkervaring als pentester;</li>\n<li>HBO werk- en denkniveau;</li>\n<li>Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) afgerond, en bereid tot verdere specialisatie (OSCE).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wat krijg je ervoor terug?</h2>\n<p>Wij bieden een baan in een informele en gedreven werkomgeving. Je bent werkzaam in een omgeving waarbij collega\u2019s ook naast het werk bezig zijn met security; zo worden periodiek avonden georganiseerd om nieuwe kennis te vergaren. Onderwerpen van deze \u201chackavonden\u201d zijn bijvoorbeeld hardware hacking, het ontdekken van nieuwe kwetsbaarheden en het uitpluizen van de nieuwste exploits.</p>\n<p>Er is een sterk stijgende vraag naar de dienstverlening die wij leveren: we groeien dus snel en er gebeurt van alles. Daardoor blijft je werk enorm gevarieerd en uitdagend. Cybercriminaliteit en de beveiliging daartegen zijn een belangrijk thema en je werkt bij KPN Security in de Nederlandse top van security experts.</p>\n<p>We bieden veel ruimte voor opleiding en training. (Inter)nationale evenementen zoals congressen en hacking/security events behoren daarin zonder twijfel tot de mogelijkheden. Maar naast deze verdieping hechten we ook veel waarde aan plezier (bedrijfsuitjes, biljart en Playstation). Wij zoeken we mensen die hun werk leuk vinden en we doen er alles aan dit te faciliteren!</p>\n<h2>Goed om te weten.</h2>\n<p>Er zijn 2 gespreksrondes aangevuld met een technische assessment\nBij vragen, schakel rechtstreeks met Bart Nollen via <a href=\"mailto:bart.nollen@kpn.com\">bart.nollen@kpn.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Bent u op zoek naar de KPN Klantenservice?

If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you\u2019ll be in great company.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients\u2019 development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Strider, you\u2019ll find a learning opportunity that\u2019s unmatched.

No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>\n<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here\u2019s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I\u2019m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager\u2019s take. We walk away with action items for next week\u2019s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I\u2019m at work at the client\u2019s office. They\u2019ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I\u2019m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride\u2019s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I\u2019m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we\u2019re retrospecting our last release. I\u2019ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I\u2019ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it\u2019s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It\u2019s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a \u2018teach a team to fish\u2019 mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC\u2019s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re a fit for Stride if you have:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of software development experience</li>\n<li>Experience in multiple programming languages</li>\n<li>Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about</li>\n<li>Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)</li>\n<li>Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace</li>\n<li>No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC</li>\n<li>$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development</li>\n</ul>\n",

You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n<p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>\n<p><strong>About Analytics Fire</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.\u201d</p>\n",
